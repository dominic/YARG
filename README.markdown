# Yet Another Responsive Grid (YARG)

_Version 0.1.0_

A flexible grid system designed to work with responsive layouts using SASS and media queries.

Based heavily on Jonathan Clem's flexible grids: http://jclem.net/2011/05/16/flexible-and-semantic-grids-with-compass/

For more on media queries, check out [Responsive Web Design](http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design) and
[320 and up](http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup/)

## Requirements

YARG is built with [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/), and requires an environment that can compile .scss files on-the-fly (i.e. Rails), or for CSS assets to be precompiled.

## Usage

My initial blog post on YARG is available [here](http://dominicdagradi.com/2011/11/14/flexibility/). More in depth documentation and examples are forthcoming!
